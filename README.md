# nosql-challenge

##Challenge:
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

##Data Sources:
In this challenge I used the following starter files: 

    -NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb
    -NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb
    -establishments.json
    
##Technologies:
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Pymongo

##Summary:
I created a new database using the Json dataset. I also updated the database with new data, deleted unecessary data and changed data types. 

In the analysis phase of this project I used pymongo queries to dig into the data. For example, I was able to use the pipeline method to find the number of establishments with a certain hygiene score.
